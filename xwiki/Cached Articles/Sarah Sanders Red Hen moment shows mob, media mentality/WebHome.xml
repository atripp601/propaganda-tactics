  <content>Sarah Huckabee Sanders’s booting from a Virginia restaurant is just a symptom of a much wider illness of left-wing intolerance. It’s part of a growing pattern of intimidation and mob scenes against Republican officials. Grass-roots activists share in the blame, of course, but the largest single accelerant is the mainstream media.&#xd;
&#xd;
The rinse and repeat cycle of anti-Trump outrage blared on nearly every news network, magazine and newspaper has fomented an increasingly brazen brand of radical ideas turning into radical action.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
Last week was a turning point. And certainly not in a good way for anyone — the administration, the media, Republicans or Democrats.&#xd;
&#xd;
The headlines and Twitter feeds have become one recycled (and often artificial) tempest outrage after another. Biased anchors and editorial rooms create a bellows effect of turning isolated incidents or policies of years prior into white-hot cauldrons of outrage. The over-the-top kabuki-theater-type “coverage” of family separations at the border acts more as undisguised activism than objective reporting. If House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) handed a check to a TV anchor on set, it would be less subtle.&#xd;
&#xd;
Every new affront ratchets up the already-tense leftist base and riles up Republican RINOs. Except the fury doesn’t match the underlying issues. The Trump border policy, coupled with enforcement of provisions dating back to George W. Bush, has been willfully extrapolated to extremes by the people who should be refereeing political debate. Instead, we have, for example, a deceptive (to put it charitably) TIME Magazine cover and mental gymnastics to hide President Obama’s own family separations and child cages, all funneling red meat (or a non-cruelty tofu substitute) to the Resistance base.&#xd;
&#xd;
This miscarriage of responsibility has — and will have — real-world ramifications.&#xd;
&#xd;
The maelstrom reached a crescendo Thursday due to Melania Trump’s jacket. One newspaper headline declared her an “Agent of Coat Chaos.” Her sin? Wearing an off-the-shelf jacket with the words “I REALLY DON’T CARE, DO U?” while boarding a plane to Texas.&#xd;
&#xd;
Her trip to comfort children was overshadowed by her jacket. Her jacket.&#xd;
&#xd;
She didn’t even wear the article of clothing while meeting with weeping children or with government officials. She was snapped wearing it while boarding a plane. Many on the left rightly dismissed criticism of Michelle Obama’s wardrobe — and they should stand up for this first lady’s agency to wear what she wants, when she wants to.</content>
