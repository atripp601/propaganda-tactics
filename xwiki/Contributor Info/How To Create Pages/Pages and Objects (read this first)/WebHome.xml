  <content>= Overview =&#xd;
&#xd;
== Terminology ==&#xd;
We use the following terminology (and as we'll see, these are our "Objects"):&#xd;
* "Article" - any external article, TV, or radio transcript.&#xd;
* "Author" - a person who has written an Article.&#xd;
* "Tactic" - some technique that an Author uses to unfairly manipulate a reader/listener.&#xd;
* "Category" - Tactics are groups into Categories (e.g. there's a "Lie" category with tactics like "Blatent Lie", "Lie of Omission", etc)&#xd;
* "Source" - the source of Articles, such as a TV station (e.g. Fox News)&#xd;
* "Quote" - when we critique and article, we include multiple "Quote" objects, each consisting of a quote of the Article, a rebuttal, and one or more Tactic tags.&#xd;
&#xd;
== Motivation For Objects ==&#xd;
Why all this object stuff???&#xd;
There are many places in this wiki that would be nearly impossible to maintain manually:&#xd;
* The Categories page lists every Tactic that's in that Category&#xd;
* The Tactics page shows every Quote from every Article that is "tagged" with that tactic&#xd;
* Source page shows every Author tagged with that source.&#xd;
etc.&#xd;
In order to avoid trying to maintain this manually, we have written code to generate the data that we need, For example, on the Categories page, we loop through all the Tactic pages, looking at every Tactic object, and seeing if it's in this category, and if so, display it.&#xd;
&#xd;
This means that, for example, someone can simply create an Article (along with any Authors, Sources, Tactics that it will refer to) and not worry about all the pages that might need to be updates to include the new Article.&#xd;
&#xd;
It also means that to create pages, you do nothing more than *add objects* to the page, and don't worry about how those objects are displayed (using HTML, Wiki Syntax, CSS, and all that stuff). This can take some getting used to.&#xd;
&#xd;
== Rules for Pages ==&#xd;
* Pages MUST live in the proper folder: Articles, Tactics, Categories, Sources, Authors, Cached Articles.&#xd;
* Pages MUST ONLY consist of Objects, nothing else:&#xd;
** Each Article page MUST contain:&#xd;
*** A single PArticleClass object&#xd;
*** A single ArticleOverviewClass object&#xd;
*** One or more PQuoteClass object&#xd;
** Each Tactic page MUST contain:&#xd;
*** A single PTacticsClass object&#xd;
** Each Category page MUST contain:&#xd;
*** A single PCategoryClass object&#xd;
** Each Author page MUST contain:&#xd;
*** A single PAuthorClass object&#xd;
** Each Source page MUST contain:&#xd;
*** A single PSourceClass object&#xd;
